9.12.2023	Binomial Approximation	Binomial approximation is a mathematical technique used to estimate the probability distribution of a binomial random variable when certain conditions are met. The binomial distribution describes the probability of a fixed number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials, each with the same probability of success. However, in situations where the number of trials is large and the probability of success is not too extreme, the binomial distribution can be computationally intensive. Binomial approximation, often applied through the Central Limit Theorem, simplifies the calculation by approximating the binomial distribution with a normal distribution. This approximation is particularly useful in statistical analysis, allowing for easier computation and interpretation of probabilities. As the sample size increases, the shape of the binomial distribution becomes increasingly bell-shaped, resembling a normal distribution, making the binomial approximation a valuable tool in various fields, including finance, biology, and quality control.
